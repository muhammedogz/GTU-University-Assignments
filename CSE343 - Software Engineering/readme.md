## Introduction

ALPRS is an innovative video detection system that automatically detects car plates from video feeds and logs the detected information into our database. The software is primarily comprised of three main components:

1. **Image Processing** - This component processes video feeds and isolates the license plates for recognition.
2. **Back-End** - This component manages data processing and storage.
3. **Front-End** - This component provides a user-friendly interface to interact with the system.

## Technologies

The system was developed using a range of technologies:

1. **Image Processing** - Python has been used with libraries like OpenCV to process and isolate car plates from video feeds.
2. **Back-End** - The back-end is built on .Net which manages data processing and interaction with the database.
3. **Front-End** - The front-end interface of the system is built using React.js.

## Setup

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
2. Set up the Python environment and install the required Python libraries
3. Set up the .Net environment
4. Set up the React.js environment
