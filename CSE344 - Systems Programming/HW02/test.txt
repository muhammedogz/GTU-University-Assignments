Process P will read an ASCII file (denoted by inputfilepath) provided as a commandline argument.
It will interpret every character in it as un unsigned byte. Consecutively read 3 bytes are interpreted
as integer coordinates in a 3-dimensional space. Every i-th group of consecutive 10 coordinates it
reads, are forwarded to a child process R_i. The child process R_i will be created by P using the
fork+exec paradigm. The 10 coordinates will be passed to the child process as environment
variables. Once P reaches the end of the file (or there are less than 10 coordinates left), P will collect
the outputs of the calculations of its children processes. The outputs will take place in an output file
(denoted by outputfilepath) and will be in the form of one matrix from each R_i. Then P will
calculate the two matrices that are closest to each other with respect to the Frobenius norm, and
print them on stdout and terminate.
